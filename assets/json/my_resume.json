Designed multi-scale object representations and an optimal-transport–based matching algorithm to propagate grasps and trajectories directly from geometric structure. Integrated the method with MimicGen to generate diverse demonstrations and validated its effectiveness through simulation and real-world execution on a Franka Panda robot.",

Designed a selective experience replay strategy to prioritize task-relevant, high-confidence features, effectively reducing semantic noise during continual learning. The resulting system achieved a +4.36 improvement in localization accuracy over the previous state of the art, significantly enhancing downstream navigation reliability.",

The approach achieved state-of-the-art performance in both seen and unseen environments in the AI2-THOR simulator and successfully transferred navigation policies to physical robots in a zero-shot setting, demonstrating reliable real-world task completion.
