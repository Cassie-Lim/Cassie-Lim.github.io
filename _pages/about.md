HiðŸ‘‹! I am Mengying Lin, a 1st year MS Robotics student at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) with [Prof. Danfei Xu](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~danfei/). I am interested in learning generalizable (task/scene/...) representation for robotic tasks.

I obtained my bachelor degree from the [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/), advised by [Shiguang Shan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=Vkzd7MIAAAAJ) and [Dongbin Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=RxvYlNQAAAAJ). I have been working as a research intern at the [Institute for AI Industry Research (AIR)](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm) with Dr. [Zike Yan](https://zikeyan.github.io/).
